# Application Testing Documentation

This document outlines the testing strategies employed to ensure the functionality and reliability of our application. We utilize two primary testing methodologies: automated integration testing and manual end-to-end testing.

## 1. Automated Integration Testing

Automated integration tests are designed to test the interactions with the backend api  of the application to ensure it works  as expected. We use Postman to conduct these tests.

- ** Postman automated tests :** [Postman](/scAIentific%20backend.postman_collection.json)

## 2. Manual End-to-End Testing

Our manual end-to-end testing involves comprehensive user scenarios to test the application from the user's perspective. These tests are designed to capture potential issues in the user interface and user experience flows.

- **Documentation:** The test scenarios are documented in the file `scAIentific_Frontend_Test_Scenarios.md` located in the root of our repository. This document provides detailed steps and expected outcomes for each test case.

For more details on each type of test, please refer to the respective documentation linked above.
