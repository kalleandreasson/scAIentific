# scAIentific: AI-powered Research Front Analyzer

## Overview

scAIentific is an innovative application tailored specifically for researchers and students deeply involved in their specific fields of study. This advanced AI-powered tool specializes in providing expert assistance by analyzing a vast array of scientific articles to identify key trends, themes, and findings that align precisely with the userâ€™s current research focus. scAIentific is designed to streamline the research process, making the exploration of cutting-edge research more efficient and accessible. It saves valuable time and resources, enhancing productivity and insight. This project is the result of a collaborative effort by students as part of a university group initiative, showcasing the practical application of AI in academic research.

## Developers

This project was developed by a group of students:

- **[Shirin Meirkhan](https://github.com/Shirin20)**
- **[kalle Andreasson](https://github.com/kalleandreasson)**

### Project Origin

The need for scAIentific arose from the challenges faced by researchers in summarizing extensive previous works, a task particularly daunting when writing dissertations or scientific papers. An example project examining gender differences in networking during college years highlighted the labor-intensive process of manually identifying relevant research trends from a pool of 250 scientific articles.

### Purpose

scAIentific's goal is to explore how AI can facilitate and streamline the process of research front analysis, potentially uncovering insights that manual methods might miss.

### Project Goals

- Develop an app that gives the user the ability to create an Ai assistant, that is expert in a research area of the user choice, that will help the user to find and describe the current research front.
- Provide a user-friendly frontend for uploading research articles and receiving the needed results.

## Features

- **Article Upload**: Users can upload files (.docx) up to 512 MB directly into the AI assistant.
- **Custom AI-Assistant Creation**: Allows users to create a personalized AI assistant. This specialized assistant is proficient in a research field specified by the user.
- **Research Discussion with the AI-Assistant**: Offers the capability to converse with the assistant and discuss the file's content, assisting in the identification of the research front.
- **The AI-Assistant chat history**: The user will get the chat history sent to their mail.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Blazor
- **Backend**: C#, .NET
- **Ai Model**: Open ai chat GPT 4.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET core 8.
- An IDE such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code
- Access to the provided AI model or equivalent
- Create a mail for the application to enable that chat history sending feature.
- Set mongoBD Atlas database connectionstring.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure all required software and dependencies are installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory and restore the required packages:

```shell
dotnet restore
```

4. Start the backend server:

```shell
dotnet run --project Path/To/BackendProject
```

5. Start the frontend application:

```shell
cd Path/To/FrontendProject
dotnet run
```

## Usage

- Navigate to the frontend application through your web browser.
- Register a new user, login and create your Ai research assistant and start interacting with it.
